        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Cupcakes are small, tasty snack cakes that are favored for their portability and portion-control.<br>
            They are batter cakes baked in a cup-shaped foil or temperature resistant paper. A cupcake can be prepared<br>
            from a variety of formulations and can be decorated with cream and icings.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 ¾ cups self-rising flour, sifted</li>
            <li>6 medium eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). If using a metal giant cupcake pan,<br>
                    thoroughly grease all sides and dust with flour, tapping to remove any excess. If using<br>
                    a silicone cake pan, there is no need to grease.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Combine sugar and butter in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and<br>
                    fluffy. Add in flour alternately with beaten eggs, a little at a time, beating well after<br>
                    each addition. Stir in vanilla extract. Divide the mixture between the top and bottom<br>
                    giant cupcake pans.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean,<br>
                    50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool in the pan, then turn out to cool completely on a wire rack.<br>
                    Once cool, frost and decorate as desired with your favorite frosting.
