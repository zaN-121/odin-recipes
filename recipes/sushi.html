        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, <br>
                    cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot<br>
                    and set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of<br>
                    rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over<br>
                    rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over <br>
                    filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</p>
